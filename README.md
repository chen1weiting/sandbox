# cp1404 prac-7: clean code by Weiting Chen

_A list of at least 3 main lessons i have learned about "clean code" in this subject.

## 1. Clean code is simple.

The same goes for long-winded code that takes forever to get to the point.

## 2. Clean code is readable.

If the naming conventions, spacing, structure, and flow used in a program are not designed with the reader in mind, then
that reader will almost certainly fail to understand the original authorâ€™s intent.

## 3. Clean code is tested.

Writing clean code means writing tested code.
